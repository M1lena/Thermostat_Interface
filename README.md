This thermostat's web interface allows users to increase and decrease the temperaure. The thermostat has a Power Saving mode that is turned on by default. When the Power Saving mode is turned on, the maximum temperature that can be setis 25 degrees; if this mode is turned off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees. The minimum temperature, regardless of Power Saving mode, is 10 degrees.

The web-interface is color-coded based on the set temperature.

The interface uses the [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/api) to display the current London temperature.
