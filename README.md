This project was coded during the first week of learning JavaScript and JQuery. Started April 13, 2015.

This is a pair-programming project with [Andrea](https://github.com/armi1189), built using JavaScript, JQuery, and HTML, and tested with Jasmine.

This thermostat's web interface allows users to increase and decrease the temperaure. The thermostat has a power saving mode which is turned on by default. If Power Saving mode is turned on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees; if this mode is turned off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees.

The web-interface is color-coded based on the current temperature.

The interface uses the [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/api) to display current London temperature.
