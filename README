Thermostat Interface

This project was coded during the first week of learning JavaScript and JQuery.

This is a pair-programming project with armi1189, built using JavaScript, JQuery, and HTML and tested with Jasmine. Started April 13, 2015.

This thermostat's web interface allows users to increase and decrease the temperaure. The thermostat has a power saving mode which is turned on by default. If Power Saving mode is turned on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees; if this mode is turned off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees.

The web-interface is color-coded based on the current temperature.
